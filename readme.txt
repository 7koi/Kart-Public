Here is the beginning of SRB2kart's 2.1 code.

Current version is undefined, we could use either date or legit formatting, I guess.
Date formatting is probably better for a beta work environment, until we consider it really "done".

Date format would be yyyy.mm.dd , ie  2016.01.24

I don't know what else to type here right now.
